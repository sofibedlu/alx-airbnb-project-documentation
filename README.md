## Overview

The backend system is built to support the core functionalities of an Airbnb-like platform,
including user registration and authentication, property listings, booking management, and payment processing.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register, login, and manage user sessions securely.
- **Property Management**: Create, update, delete, and retrieve property listings.
- **Booking System**: Handle booking creation, cancellation, and status management.
- **Payment Processing**: Integrate with payment gateways for secure transactions.
- **Notifications**: Send email and in-app notifications for booking updates and payment statuses.

## Architecture

The backend architecture follows a modular design, separating concerns into distinct modules for user management, property management, booking management, and payment processing.
This ensures scalability and maintainability.

## API Endpoints

### User Authentication

- `POST /auth/register`: Registers a new user.
- `POST /auth/login`: Logs in an existing user.
- `POST /auth/logout`: Logs out the user.
- `GET /auth/verify`: Verifies a user's email address.

### Property Management

- `POST /properties`: Creates a new property listing.
- `GET /properties`: Retrieves all property listings.
- `PUT /properties/:id`: Updates an existing property.
- `DELETE /properties/:id`: Deletes a property listing.

### Booking System

- `POST /bookings`: Creates a new booking.
- `GET /bookings/:id`: Retrieves details of a booking.
- `DELETE /bookings/:id`: Cancels a booking.

## Data Flow Diagram

The Data Flow Diagram (DFD) visualizes the interaction between users, processes, and data stores. It helps to understand the flow of data within the system.

For more details, refer to the [Data Flow Diagram](data-flow-diagram/README.md).

## Use Case Diagram

The Use Case Diagram illustrates the interactions between different users (guests, hosts, admins) and the system. It helps to identify key functionalities required for the backend.

For more details, refer to the [Use Case Diagram](use-case-diagram/README.md).

## User Stories

User stories capture the core interactions and functionalities necessary to fulfill user requirements. They provide a clear understanding of user needs and help in designing the system.

For more details, refer to the [User Stories](user-stories/user-stories.md).

## Tools and Technologies

- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MySQL for relational data.
- **Authentication**: JWT for secure session management.
- **Image Storage**: Cloud storage for property images (e.g., AWS S3 or File System).
- **Error Handling**: Implement global error handling for all endpoints.

For more details, refer to the [Tools and Technologies](requirements.md#üõ†Ô∏è-tools-and-technologies).
